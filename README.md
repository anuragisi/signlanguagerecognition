# signlanguagerecognition
This is the latest working code of the sign language recognition system which enables us to recognise the symbols as characters easily as we have done researched over the algorithms to try to get the best results in a simple and best way.We have used python 2.7 with OpenCV 3.0 Library.

Let us assume that you have installed opencv 3.0 and python 2.7 correctly.
Then run it as simple as running a python program.

If any error happens let us know,then we will feel happy to help you.

Note : 
Few more documentations i will be adding in this code.
