# signlanguagerecognition
This is the latest working code of the sign language recognition system which enables us to recognise the symbols as characters easily as we have done researched over the algorithms to try to get the best results in a simple and best way.We have used python 2.7 with OpenCV 3.0 Library.

Let us assume that you have installed opencv 3.0 and python 2.7 correctly.
Then run it as simple as running a python program.

If any error happens let us know,then we will feel happy to help you.

# Gesture Recognition
<p>Gesture recognition is a topic in computer science and language technology with the goal of interpreting human gesture via mathematical algorithms.</p>

<ul>Hardware Tools used in Gesture Recognition:
  <li>1. Wired gloves</li>
  <li>2. Depth-aware cameras</li>
  <li>3. Stereo cameras</li>
  <li>4. Controller-based gestures</li>
  <li>5. Single camera</li>
  In our project we have implemented sign language recognition on a single camera.
</ul>
